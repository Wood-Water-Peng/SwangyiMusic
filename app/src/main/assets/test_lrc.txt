[00:04.22]歌∶椎名林檎×斉藤ネコ
[00:06.22]
[00:07.74]I know I don't quite measure up against you
[00:15.71]The whole context in which we met was innocent
[00:23.77]Your charming ways deserve the blame for our time
[00:31.71]It wasn't me who led;　your words spoke confidence
[00:37.74]
[00:39.93]One long day it came with a rush
[00:43.77]We've tied ourselves up together, but the knot is loose
[00:50.42]
[00:51.41]I adore the way your face breaks out into a smile
[00:59.47]Like a flower in spring that blooms to life so radiant
[01:07.89]I can't forget your lush sweet lips that kiss me
[01:15.75]How many are the men charmed by your elegance
[01:21.68]
[01:23.99]Whom have you worked this magic on before?
[01:27.74]Let it be only me forever since I want it more
[01:35.85]Give it only to me please
[01:39.29]
[03:47.85][01:39.90]So smile come put your lips right next to mine
[03:55.97][01:47.92]Moonlight showers down on you like flower blossoms
[04:03.89][01:55.91]Come on right now, lay down with me and sing lullabies
[04:11.37][02:03.37]Somehow let me live this dream with you, endlessly
[04:20.83][02:12.70]
[02:27.72]You're quick and bright so pacify my complaints
[02:35.73]You hide your thoughts and shroud yourself in mystery
[02:43.75]You've never learned what deep inside I'm craving
[02:51.66]When you leaned against my shoulder I did notice it
[02:57.99]
[02:59.92]When did you make a hole inside of me?
[03:03.97]Trapped in this room, suffocating in your niceties
[03:11.71]I'm losing my mind to more fits of jealousy
[03:15.35]
[03:15.96]Now cry come put your lips right next to mine
[03:23.79]High tide, I'm swimming in a sea of your tears
[03:31.74]Come on right now, no need to treat me nice anymore
[03:39.40]Somehow I want to hide myself somewhere away from you
[03:47.24]
[05:05.83]終わり
